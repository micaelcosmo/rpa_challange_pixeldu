In your project, you have a folder that is used to store temporary files, such as .png images that are extracted from processed news articles. This folder serves as a temporary storage location for these files before they are further processed or used in your application.

Using a dedicated folder for temporary files is a common practice in software development. It helps keep your project organized and ensures that temporary files are stored separately from other important files. This can make it easier to manage and clean up these files when they are no longer needed.

By storing extracted .png images in this temporary folder, you can easily access and manipulate them as needed during the processing of news articles. Once you have finished working with these files, you can either delete them or move them to a different location, depending on your project requirements.

It's important to note that temporary files should not be relied upon for long-term storage or as a permanent solution. They are meant to be used temporarily and should be cleaned up regularly to avoid cluttering your project directory and consuming unnecessary disk space.
